## Introduction (from Prompt)

_The mobile and connected world of today generates a large amount of data that needs to be managed, analysed, and linked. This is often done on the cloud. The development, deployment, and management of this is called Cloud Computing. The purpose of this course is to offer a wide background about designing, developing, deploying, testing, and monitoring a cloud solution, specifically with a focus on big data problems._
